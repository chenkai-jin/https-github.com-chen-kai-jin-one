# Q&A Summary (English Version Only)

## Q1: Summarize the news about the Taiwanese high school student in five sentences.
**A:**  
A high school student surnamed Yang from Taichung had their medical school admissions (NYCU, TMU, CSU) revoked for submitting falsified learning records, sparking widespread controversy.  
A self-proclaimed first alternate for NYCU’s medical program posted on Threads thanking the opportunity and even invited Yang to Japan, which drew criticism for being insensitive and mean-spirited.  
The same user posted twice to celebrate their backup admission and plans to travel abroad, but was condemned for being more offensive than the cheater due to their provocative tone.  
Some netizens questioned the authenticity of the user’s identity, suspecting they were a troll seeking attention, as their IP did not match the real alternate student.  
The incident led to public scrutiny of the portfolio-based application system; the Ministry of Education emphasized its broader purpose, and scholars called for reforms.

## Q2: Write a short story (under 2000 characters) about a crow growing into the legendary Chinese “Golden Crow.”
**A:**  
A crow named Mo Yu, mocked for his crimson feathers, dreams of the Golden Crow who guides him through three trials: courage, wisdom, and sacrifice.  
He first retrieves the Flame Stone from a lava river, which begins to turn his feathers golden.  
Next, he solves the ancient riddle of Owl Emperor Tianhuang, earning further golden glow.  
Finally, he leaps into a volcano, sacrificing his feathers and body, and is reborn from ash as the Golden Crow.  
Now, he rises in the east every day, lighting Crow Valley—his eternal flame a symbol of sacrifice and hope. (Approx. 600 words in original)

## Q3: I'm a high school math teacher. How can I make memorizing trig values for 30°, 45°, and 60° fun?
**A:**  
Create a "Triangle Island Treasure Hunt" themed lesson using stories, visuals, and games to teach sin, cos, and tan.  
Introduce the angles with characters like “Agile Elf (sin),” “Calm Knight (cos),” and “Fiery Hunter (tan)” for storytelling.  
Draw triangle visuals (1:√3:2 and 1:1:√2), use rhymes like “Thirty degrees, sin is one-half, cos is root three over two,” and add rhythmic chants.  
In-class team games can let students solve problems to earn "treasure fragments," reinforced with real-life examples like ramps and game design.  
Extension ideas include taking photos of real-world angles and playing online maze games to strengthen memory and engagement.
